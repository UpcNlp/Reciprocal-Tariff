In Mankiw or Paul Samuelson's economics book (can't remember whose) , the first section was to talk about how the US government subsided US formers to boost export. The US government is subsiding semiconductor industry now, while China has been subsiding EV and Tesla in China also received subsiding, same as other Chinese or foreign brands in China market. The UK supports corporate tax return for R&D cost and it is a different way of subsiding. The average tariff in the EU is around 2.5%, China is about 3.3%, US is higher than both EU and China, but India is the king of tariff as Trump said, as its average tariff is 13%, which is the highest among the marjor economies."
