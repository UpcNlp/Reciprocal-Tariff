        "For all you inept trump supporters. China buys 6% of its imports from USA, total $143 billion USA buys 40% of its imports from China total? $3.2 trillion a year ( a light figure as it’s from 2022 it’s way more now) lol 104 % tariff on 3.2 trillion is 3.3trillion all of which USA importers pay, versus 84% of $143 billion is $120billion paid by Chinese importers. That’s 27 times more money this costs USA importers than it does Chinese importers or $3.18 trillion dollars more…. It costs you in USA more now! There is no way USA will now make 40 % of what it imports cheaper than what China makes it even with a 104% tariff so you all just pay more tax in the form of tariffs and still get items at best half the price of what you’d pay if it was made in USA"
