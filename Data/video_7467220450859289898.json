        "Not all of what you mentioned is going to have a tariff on it. He’s making it sound like once trump puts a tarriff on a country they have to pay to import everything no he’s going to put tariffs on certain things that will benefit the US and make it so we don’t have to rely on other countries products. Also it is going to be used as leverage. I guarantee we come out on top nobody wants to risk losing the U.S business being we are the owners of the US dollar. At least he’s trying something else other than having wars over oil rights and minerals. We’ve got to start thinking long term and to end up not becoming a 3rd world country. Which I feel like we kind of are at this point but this next decade or so is vital to the survival of the U.S"
