        "TikTok takes down my videos if I give direct advice which is understandable. I don’t know if you have ever posted any type of content but try it and you will see 😃",
        "Again, missing the point of the video. Circulation was basically 0 when COVID shutdown every business. Guess what markets did? All Time Highs. There is no correlation. Purpose of the video was that.",
        "Live below ur means",
        "Yes however this video recorded last night. But what I said in the video is still true, these tariffs are open for negotiations for other countries if they come to Trump",
        "Yes I am aware of that. However, if you actually watch the full video the entire purpose was to alert people of the discounted prices and how they might be able to capitalize",
        "In regards to trade, we are expected to run huge deficits in 2026 with debt ceiling raised almost every other year. Tariffs make sense in the long run compared to the % other countries have on us",
        "100%, but this video is more about trying to aware people of what’s currently happening so they know and not regret it later when they miss out big time",
        "And recovered immediately and never came back to those levels. You guys need to spend more time behind the charts than comments",
        "Layoffs started like last year lol 😂",
        "Terrorist? I’m sure you meant Tariffs and yes they are up for negotiations. Vietnam is currently already negotiating. It is okay to be wrong 👍",
        "Everyone called Michael Burry crazy. TikTok kids in the comments barely even have points to note",
        "Legality mate",
        "As you can see by the video, it’s night time. Video was recorded last night. And no, you are wrong. That’s why when Covid hit, markets were soaring while every business was shut down = no revenue.",
        "I may know the reason why you hate Trump lol",
        "Why did markets soar during COVID? A never-experienced global pandemic that we didn’t have a vaccine for till months in lockdown. Full of uncertainty still we gained. Because it is engineered to do so"
