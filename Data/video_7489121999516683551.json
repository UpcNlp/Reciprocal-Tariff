Panic is breaking out on the stock markets. Numerous economists and economic experts have been spotted tearing their hair out... Stop! According to the White House, the punitive tariffs are to be suspended until further notice – at least for 36 minutes, the White House announced. Stock prices are rising again... No! Punitive tariffs apply like... No way. Hold on! Dow Jones down! No way! Dow Jones up! Hold on! DAX down! No way! DAX up! Hold on! Nasdaq down! No way! Nasdaq up! Hold on! Investors poor! No way! Investors rich! Hold on! Stock traders are jumping out the window! No way! Stockbrokers are climbing through the windows again! Wait a minute! White House insiders are buying cheap. Nope, not at all! White House insiders are selling high. Wait a minute! Global economy is crashing! Nope, not at all! Global economy is recovering! Wait a minute! No! We're lost! Wait a minute! We're saved! Wait a minute… We'll keep you updated. 😜"
