During the game, with all his bluffs and reputation, he went “all in”. He thought everyone would fold. But, xi opened his cards then asked donald to open his own. Donald refused but bluffing and threating even more. Everyone on the table start questioning donald’s reputation. Donald is losing but he won’t admit it. Everyone on the table is upset now, and they don’t want to play with donald anymore. The impact for the other countries would be short term, but not for donald’s country, the impact will be long term, could be permanent. Donald’s country is losing trust especially for leading the world. Donald has waken everyone, that buying donald’s overpriced with hundreds percent markup products makes you looks stupid. Now everyone avoiding buying donald’s product except several product like apple, google, meta, microsoft, etc. Thanks donald and maga voters🤣"
