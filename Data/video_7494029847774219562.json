The 4th. commandment as an eternal decree, and one of the 10. Commandments). 📣 Rev 14:8-10: \"...Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great citie, because she made all nations drinke of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.📌(The Papacy, which has changed the Commandments of God, and all the religious organizations that agree with it.) 📣Rev 18:4-5: \"And I heard another voice from heauen, saying, Come out of her, my people, that yee be not partakers of her sinnes, and that yee receiue not of her plagues: For her sinnes haue reached vnto heauen, and God hath remembred her iniquities.\" 📣 Rev 14:9-10: If any man worship the beast and his image, and receiue his marke in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, which is powred out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and hee shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lambe: \"And the smoke of their torment ascendeth vp for euer and euer. And they haue no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoeuer receyueth the marke of his name. Here is the patience of the Saints: Here are they that keepe the Commandements of God, and the faith of Iesus.\" 📌(The mark of the beast is. ‼️Sunday‼️. A day imposed by the papacy instead of the Biblical Sabbath). ‼️❗️It is clear that everyone who despises the Law of God and obeys the decree of men will receive the mark of the beast; he will receive a sign of loyalty to the power that he prefers to God. But no one will experience the wrath of God until the truth is brought to the mind and conscience of every one and rejected. People will not blindly accept this decree. Everyone will have sufficient light to make a conscious choice."
