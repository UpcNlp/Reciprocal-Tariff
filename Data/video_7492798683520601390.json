        "Trump should not completely anger China. China holds 800-1.2 trillion U.S. Treasury bonds. If China gets really angry and sells off these U.S. Treasury bonds, the U.S. financial sector will collapse, the dollar will depreciate rapidly, and the economy will completely collapse. The core of the United States is the hegemony of the US dollar. When there are no buyers for US Treasury bonds, the hegemony of the US dollar will no longer exist, which means that the United States is bankrupt. Of course, many countries no longer trust the United States and have begun to sell off U.S. Treasury bonds. This is why the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose sharply last week. The trend of selling U.S. Treasury bonds has been formed;"
