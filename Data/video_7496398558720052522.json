A lot of preparation went into facing Trump’s tariff war, like lowering exports to the US, increasing exports to other part of the world. Increasing domestic consumption. Looking for other countries to replace US imports. Everyone now know that China replaced US beef with Australian beef, US soybeans with Brazilian soybeans, US crude oil with Canadian crude oil, US LNG with UAE LNG. These deals didn’t just all of a sudden happen after the liberation day, the negotiations and talks were happening months before. China did a lot without yapping about it."
