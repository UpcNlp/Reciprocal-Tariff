There won’t be no reason for any tariffs anyway because what’s the point because at the end of the day no one‘s working with them and they’ll actually lose billions of dollars And the stock market obviously is going to crash. They will be in the worst recession of the generation and I’ll be Donald Trump issue of getting America out of recession and won’t work if no one is working with the US no one wants to work with the US anymore and that’s common sense. I don’t blame them. There’s no point following America into another wall no point following America anymore in general."
