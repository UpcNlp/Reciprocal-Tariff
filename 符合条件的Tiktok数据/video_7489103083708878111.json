        "A correction to your video. You said the consumer pays the tariff. This is wrong. The Importer, who’s going to resell the car pays the tariff. Then the importer will sell the car to the consumer with an increased cost to make up for the tariff. Consumer is paying the costs of goods plus a markup for the seller. The cost of goods is the cost of the car, the freight, the tariff, and other expenses and taxes. Ultimately the consumer bares the costs but that would also happen if the manufacturing costs went up too. The way you worded it sounds like the consumer is importing 1 car, but it’s actually a company importing many cars to sell.",
