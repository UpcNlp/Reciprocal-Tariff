Make imported goods more expensive, so people are more likely to buy local products. 2. Earn revenue from foreign companies that sell goods in the country. 3. Protect local industries from foreign competition. Example: If a country puts a 10% tariff on imported shoes, and a pair of shoes from another country costs $100, then the buyer would pay $110 — $100 for the shoes + $10 tariff."
