        "For starters America wouldn’t even bother because they know that they would lose because they needed the allies that they screwed over to help them and their allies is breaking away from their manipulation and even if their allies did help them, they were still wouldn’t win because the defense force that China has and the defense force and the weapons that both China and Russia has America doesn’t stand a chance at all even if it was nuclear war, the whole world versus Russia and China yeah good luck they’re going to win not America not Australia not Canada. Not the UK not NATO… Russia, and China would win because America under Donald Trump is weak. They talk very degrading about the world like the Chinese people peasants. They have been aggressive since Donald Trump was sworn in and just how they political party and people talk about the world that’s dangerous America needs their allies to win any war like they didn’t even bother getting into World War II until Pearl Harbor was bombed 😂 otherwise they were in France, doing illegal things even before the war even started and then when Germany invaded the rest of the world, they only got their allies involved to fight their war that they will eventually after Pearl Harbor got bombed so they can cut off the circulation of the world, so they can then go into the wall after Pearl Harbor and say that we won they have never won a war by themselves ever America is weak. China would literally rip them apart if they were bombed by America all hell will break loose only because if this did happen, Russia will be at China’s doorstep within seconds along with the Chinese allies and the Russian allies because they have allies America is starting to lose their allies because of what they’re doing to the world they could easily team up with NATO, but they have destroyed all relationships throughout the world. You don’t do that to your allies and think that you’ll get away with it one day America will need their allies and they’re just going to turn around and say goodbye. Get off our doorstep and their allies that they end up losing will end up siding with American enemies because America will and has become a dangerous country you know school shootings pretty much every day or every second day and apparently America is the home of the brave and the home of the free 😂 really 😂 Wow"
